<p>Brett was the internal game authoring tool, where you could preview assets, edit scenes, setup animation sequences, etc. Becky was the rendering engine for the tool, that we were tasked to keep as close as possible to the game rendering engine.</p>
<p>I had the chance to come in early in the development and touch a lot of low-level stuff:
	<ul>
		<li>Reading a collada file exported by 3Ds Max.</li>
		<li>Phong-Blinn shader with skinning support.</li>
		<li>Importing and displaying model animations.</li>
		<li>Selecting objects in a scene and being able to move/rotate/scale them using the transformation gizmo.</li>
		<li>A cinematic editor.</li>
		<li>A curve editor.</li>
	</ul>
